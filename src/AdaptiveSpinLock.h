/// AdaptiveSpinLock implements _BasicLockable_ and _Lockable_ requirements of
/// _C++11_, and as such, it is perfectly usable with
/// `std::lock_guard`, `std::unique_lock` and similar mutex wrappers.
///
/// It uses `std::atomic_flag` to guarantee HW support for synchronization.
/// On request, it actively waits for the lock to be released by other threads,
/// but after a certain cycle count, it gives back the rest of the timeslice to
/// the OS in order to avoid draining battery or becoming a CPU hog.
/// Use this for short operations to minimize delay in other threads.

  ///        then, it will probably require quite some experimentation to find
  ///        the setting most suitable for your particular use case.
  ///        Higher values will result in more busy waiting for locks and
  ///        therefore more wasted CPU time, while lower values will shorten
  ///        the time before a the lock gives up its timeslice, possibly
  ///        leading to higher delay on lock acquisitions.
