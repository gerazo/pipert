/// A Channel represents storage for a single stage in the data processing
/// chain, and receives data of type T into its buffer through `Packet<T>`
/// objects.
///
/// A Channel is a circular buffer of `Packet<T>` objects which are used to
/// pass data around in the DSP pipeline.
/// This buffer is of a fixed size, allocated at _set up_ time.
/// No memory allocation is done during _run-time_ in the system.
///
/// Channels are always owned by a Scheduler object, they do not exist alone.
/// They are always connected to a _Node_ object which receives data through
/// them.
/// Usually the _Node_ object is the one that creates Channels using
/// Scheduler::CreateScheduledChannel() or Scheduler::CreatePolledChannel().
///
/// Packets filled up with data can either be
/// - Automatically scheduled for processing (job) by a worker thread.
///   See ScheduledChannel for details.
/// - Manually polled for new data by your own, custom thread.
///   See PolledChannel for details.
///
/// In either case, the order of scheduling is respected
/// (earliest deadline first).
///
/// Therefore, a Channel exposes the interface for:
/// - _Acquiring_ a PacketToFill by requesting a memory address from the packet
///   pool hidden in the implementation. Anyone who has access to a Channel can
///   send data through it by acquiring and filling up a Packet.
/// - _Pushing_ a PacketToFill to be queued for processing.
/// - _Releasing_ an already processed PacketToProcess from the packet pool to
///   be "freed" so its memory location can be reused.
///
/// \tparam T User supplied data type representing the data stored in the
///           `Packet<T>` objects that flow through the Channel buffer.
