/// A Scheduler is the main object of a pipeline that owns all Channel objects
/// and is responsible for the scheduling of processing tasks.
///
/// One Scheduler object governs a complete DSP pipeline, all its operations
/// and the data structures that are connected to it.
/// A Scheduler runs a real-time system when it is in its _running state_,
/// so no memory allocations are done during the operation of the pipeline.
/// This means that any configuration (including creating Channel objects)
/// should be done before setting the pipeline into a the _running_ state by
/// using the Start() method.
///
/// A Scheduler keeps up a fixed number of _worker threads_ that are used to
/// execute processing functions of _nodes_ connected to the receiver side
/// of ScheduledChannel objects.
/// Scheduling is done by minimizing the delay between useful work units
/// and also minimizing the amount of time a Packet spends in the pipeline.
///
/// During the operation of the pipeline, no memory is allocated.
/// All Channel objects use a fixed, preconfigured size buffer where Packet
/// objects stay in place.
/// This way, buffers are not moved in memory and transforming operations
/// push the data forward from one buffer to an other one residing in the
/// next Channel in the pipeline.
///
/// There is an option to connect your own, custom threads to the pipeline by
/// using a PolledChannel.
/// A PolledChannel has all the buffering functionality but the Packet objects
/// in its buffer are not subject to scheduling done by the Scheduler.
/// Instead, the user can poll the buffer from a custom thread.
/// This can be used to implement _UI threads_ or to create _exit points_ from
/// the pipeline transferring data to an other system.
///
/// A pipeline ran by a Scheduler is really flexible. You can have an arbitrary
/// number of _entry and exit points_ and also _feedback loops_ in the chain.
/// Until timestamps are correct, scheduling is done accordingly.
///
/// To ease creating and changing pipelines during development,
/// the structure of a pipeline is not stored by the system.
/// Instead, direct connections and references to Channel objects from user
/// supplied _nodes_ are governing the flow direction of data.
/// Nevertheless, this data flow can be traced and measured nicely by the
/// built-in monitoring system.
///
/// You can have multiple Scheduler objects running in parallel.
/// This means you will run more, completely independent pipelines together.
/// However, you should keep in mind that these will fight for the same CPU
/// resources despite being isolated in memory.

  /// \param single_thread_object This parameter determines the
  ///        mutual exclusion the Scheduler will employ when calling the
  ///        registered callback function.
  ///        This depends on the _Node_ which will be called.
  ///        There are 3 typical scenarios:
  ///        - For _stateless_ node objects, use `nullptr`, so all free
  ///          threads can call the registered callback simultaneously.
  ///          This will allow full parallelism processing multiple
  ///          packets simultaneously.
  ///          The drawback is that the called function (or Node object)
  ///          should only use local or `thread_local` resources
  ///          to avoid conflicting with itself.
  ///        - For _stateful_ nodes, give a unique pointer here,
  ///          practically your Node object's `this` pointer.
  ///          In this case, only one thread will enter your object code at
  ///          any single time, so you can use object member data without any
  ///          synchronization primitives.
  ///        - For _stateful_ nodes with multiple Channel objects, use
  ///          the same pointer in all to-be-created channels connecting to
  ///          the same object. (Practically the same this pointer.)
  ///          This way, from all Channel objects connected to your Node,
  ///          only one callback will be scheduled at the same time.
  ///          This implements mutual exclusion between all connected channels.
  ///          This also allows normal member data usage without parallel
  ///          primitives in case of complex Nodes having multiple input
  ///          channels.
  /// \param callback A callback function to be registered in the new Channel.
  ///                 This is the function a worker thread of the Scheduler
